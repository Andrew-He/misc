Programs that manage a set of workers
=====================================

  Programs that start with 'p' are multi-process workers,
  programs that start with 't' are multi-thread workers.


* pworkers1.c:  signal-based manager of 'n' worker processes (sigsuspend)
* pworkers2.c:  signal-based manager of 'n' worker processes (sigwaitinfo)
* tworkers1.c:  main thread keeps a queue serviced by 'n' worker threads 
* tworkers2.c:  main thread keeps a queue serviced by 'n' worker threads.
                This program has a bug. When the main thread receives a 
                signal, it cancels the worker threads and 'joins' (collects)
                them. However only the first worker can be collected. The
                remaining worker(s) can be cancelled but hang on the join. (Why?)
* tworkers3.c:  Variant of tworkers2; uses 'shutdown' with condition broadcast 
		instead of pthread_cancel. Unlike tworkers2, upon receiving a
                signal, this program successfully joins its threads and exits.
