Programs that manage a set of workers
=====================================

  Programs that start with 'p' are multi-process workers,
  programs that start with 't' are multi-thread workers.


* pworkers1.c:  signal-based manager of 'n' worker processes (sigsuspend)
* pworkers2.c:  signal-based manager of 'n' worker processes (sigwaitinfo)
* tworkers1.c:  main thread keeps a queue serviced by 'n' worker threads
