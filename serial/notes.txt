Relation of libftdi to serial
===========================================================================
Today computers often use USB-to-serial interfaces rather than having hard-
wired serial devices. The USB-to-serial communication is often handled by
the FTDI chipset. The drivers for FTDI create a serial device e.g. /dev/ttyusb0
which can be used just like a conventional serial device. However it's also
possible to use libftdi to interact with the chip at a lower and more flexible
level. For an example of using libftdi to write data see the ../ftdi directory.
