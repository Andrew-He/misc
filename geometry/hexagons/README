This is a description of the geometry of hexagons, with sample
code for drawing hexagons in an HTML canvas. There is also a
"hextile" coordinate system for assigning x,y positions to 
plane-tiling of hexagons, and a sample of laying out a data
series (lines of a text file, in this case) as contiguous
chained series of hexagons on the plane.
